# Game-Store-Project

## Description:
It is a digital simulation of a game store where users will be able to create, delete, or update games, saving them in the store. The system also contains a library of over 100 games with preset prices, although they are not necessary. If a user wants to add a game that is not on the list of set prices, it will still work with a default price.

Using the Game Store Project, users will also be able to simulate purchasing a game by adding games to a cart, which is saved until the purchase is complete. They can check out using a customer account that will be saved for future use.

The Game Store Project may also create, delete, or show these users with a randomized 4-characterID , name, their current balance, and whether they have a membership, which gives them a 10% discount.
